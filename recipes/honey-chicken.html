        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <h3>MARINATE & DUST CHICKEN:</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Marinade:</strong> Mix Chicken and Marinade in a bowl. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dust:</strong> Spread the 1/2 cup cornflour/cornstarch on a shallow plate. Scatter over about 8 to 10 chicken pieces, toss to coat, shake off excess, put on a plate. Repeat with all chicken.</li>
                </ol>

            <h3>COLD BATTER & FRY:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Rack: Place a rack on a tray </li>
                    <li>Heat oil: Fill small pot or large saucepan with 4cm / 1.7" oil. Heat to 180°C/350°F on medium high stove (or until chicken starts sizzle straight away when dipped).</li>
                    <li>Make Cold Batter: Whisk together flour, cornflour/cornstarch, baking powder and salt. Pour in 7 tbsp soda water, then do minimum whisks just to combine (10 or so) - few lumps ok, better than whisking too much (changes coating texture).</li>
                    <li>Batter thickness: should fully coat chicken easily, not be see through, but not thick and heavy - see video at 44 seconds. Use extra water 1 teaspoon at a time to achieve right thickness.</li>
                    <li>Dredge: Drop 8 or so pieces of chicken into the batter. Turn to coat, then carefully place in oil.</li>
                    <li>Fry #1: Cook for 3 minutes until light golden and crispy - when you pick them up, you can tell it's very crispy.</li>
                    <li>Drain & repeat: Place on rack, repeat with remaining chicken - I cook in 4 batches, don't crowd the pot, brings oil temperature down too much.</li>
                    <li>Cool chicken for 20 minutes (Note 4). Meanwhile, make Sauce.</li>
                </ol>
